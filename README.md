# Simple React/Webpack

Simple React/Redux app for trying out various things

- minimal Webpack configuration - not finely tuned, but still production-ready
- organize code into "module" folders by functionality area, not type

## TODO / TOTRY
- themes with CSS - variables, color functions
- puppeteer integration tests
- entities
- JWT authentication
- redux-saga / observable
- Open Graph
- Google Analytics
- `reselect`
- css-in-js - is using styled-components justified ? vs `decss`
