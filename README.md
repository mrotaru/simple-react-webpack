# Simple React/Webpack

Building an example React/Redux app from scratch

- minimal Webpack configuration - not finely tuned, but still production-ready
- organise code into "module" folders by functionality area, not type
- a module should only export routes and reducers; export other components only
  if used in another module, althought that should be considered a code smell

## TODO
- themes with CSS - variables, color functions
- puppeteer integration tests
- entities
- JWT authentication
- redux-saga / observable
